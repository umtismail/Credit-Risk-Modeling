#  Credit Risk Modeling - Default Prediction

This project predicts the probability of serious financial distress within 2 years using machine learning techniques. The model helps financial institutions assess credit risk more accurately.

---

##  Project Objective

To build a binary classification model that predicts whether a borrower will default (SeriousDlqin2yrs = 1) based on financial features like debt ratio, income, and credit history.

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- CatBoost/XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas/Numpy
- SMOTE (Imbalanced Learning)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

##  Dataset

Dataset used: **Give Me Some Credit**  
Source: [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit)

Key Features:
- `DebtRatio`: Total monthly debt payments / monthly income
- `MonthlyIncome`: Borrower's monthly income
- `NumberOfOpenCreditLines`: Open credit lines
- `NumberOfTimes90DaysLate`: Payment delays
- `SeriousDlqin2yrs`: Target variable (1 = default within 2 years)

> âš Note: Highly imbalanced dataset (6.68% positive class)
